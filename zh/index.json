Typically; the pattern by which contact is made and broken between the mechanism and its environment determines the motion of the robot. The design of these patterns; often called contact patterns; is a difficult problem. In previous work; the prescription of contact patterns was derived from observations of biological systems or determined empirically from black-box optimization algorithms. However; such heuristic-based contact pattern prescription is only applicable to specific mechanisms; and is challenging to generalize. For example; the stable and effective contact pattern prescribed for a 12-link limbless robot can be neither stable nor effective for a 6-link limbless robot. In this paper; using a geometric motion planning scheme; we develop a framework to design; optimize; and analyze contact patterns to generate effective motion in the desired directions. Inspired by prior work in geometric mechanics; we separate the configuration space into a shape space (the internal joint angles); a contact state space; and a position space; then we optimize the function that couples the contact state space and the shape space. Our framework provides physical insights into the contact pattern design and reveals principles of empirically derived contact pattern prescriptions. Applying this framework; we can not only control the direction of motion of a 12-link limbless robot by modulating the contact patterns; but also design effective sidewinding gaits for robots with fewer motors (e.g.; a 6-link robot). We test our designed gaits by robophysical experiments and obtain excellent agreement. We expect our scheme can be broadly applicable to robots which make/break contact.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Moving sidewinding forward: optimizing contact patterns for limbless robots via geometric mechanics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tianyu Wang","Bo Lin","Baxi Chong","Julian Whitman","Matthew Travers","Daniel I.

In motion planning process, snake robot motions are often designed kinematically by a chronological sequence of continuous backbone curves that capture desired macroscopic shapes of the robot. However, as the geometric arrangement of single-axis rotary joints creates constraints on the rotations in the robot, it is challenging for the robot to reconstruct an arbitrary 3D curve. When the robot configuration does not accurately achieve the desired shapes defined by these backbone curves, the robot can have unexpected contacts with the environment, such that the robot does not achieve the desired motion. In this work, we propose a method for snake robots to reconstruct desired backbone curves by posing an optimization problem that exploits the robot's geometric structure. We verified that our method enables fast and accurate curve-configuration conversions through its applications to commonly used 3D gaits. We also demonstrated via robot experiments that 1) our method results in smooth locomotion on the robot; 2) our method allows the robot to approach the numerically predicted locomotive performance of a sequence of continuous backbone curve.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Reconstruction of Backbone Curves for Snake Robots","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bo Lin","Baxi Chong","Yasemin Ozkan-Aydin","Enes Aydin","Howie Choset","Daniel I.

The internal motion of the system is prescribed by a closed loop in the shape space, which causes net motion in the position space. If the shape space is a simply connected domain in an Euclidean space, then with an optimal choice of the body frame, the displacement in the position space is reasonably approximated by the surface integral of the height function, a functional relationship between the internal shape and position space variables. Our recent work has extended the scope of geometric methods from limbless undulatory system to those with legs; interestingly, the shape space for such systems has a torus structure. However, to the best of our knowledge, the optimal choice of the body frame on the torus shape space was not explored. In this paper, we develop a method to optimally choose the body frame on the torus which results in good approximation of displacement by the integral of the height function. We apply our methods to the centipede locomotion system and observe quantitative agreement of our prediction and experimental results.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Optimizing Coordinate Choice for Locomotion Systems with Toroidal Shape Spaces","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bo Lin"],"categories":[],"content":"Syllabus Course Syllabus Lecture Slides Lecture 1 - Chapter 0 Lecture 2 - Chapter 1 Lecture 3 - Section 1.3, Section 2.1 \u0026amp; 2.2 Lecture 4 - Section 2.3 \u0026amp; 2.4 Relations Lecture 5 - Section 3.1 \u0026amp; 3.2 Functions Lecture 6 - Section 3.3 Bijections and cardinality Lecture 7 - Section 4.1 - 4.3 Division Lecture 8 - Section 4.4 \u0026amp; 4.5 Congruences Lecture 9 - Section 5.1 Mathematical Induction Lecture 10 - Section 5.2 \u0026amp; 5.3 recursively defined sequences Lecture 11 - Section 8.1 \u0026amp; 8.2 Algorithms Lecture 12 - Section 8.3 searching \u0026amp; sorting Lecture 13 - Section 6.1 \u0026amp; 6.2 principles of counting Lecture 14 - Section 6.3 \u0026amp; 7.1 Pigeonhole principle and permutations Lecture 15 - Section 7.2 \u0026amp; 7.7 Combinations and the Binomial Theorem Lecture 16 - Section 7.3 \u0026amp; 7.4 Probability Theory Lecture 17 - Section 7.5 \u0026amp; 7.6 Repetitions and derangements Lecture 18 - Section 9.1 \u0026amp; 9.2 Graph Theory Lecture 19 - Section 9.3 Isomorphism of Graphs Lecture 20 - Section 10.1 \u0026amp; 10.2 Eulerian circuits and Hamiltonian cycles Lecture 21 - Section 10.4 Shortest path algorithms Lecture 22 - Section 12.1 \u0026amp; 12.2 Trees Lecture 23 - Section 12.3 \u0026amp; 12.5 Minimal Spanning Trees \u0026amp; Depth-First Search Lecture 24 - Section 13.1 Planar Graphs Lecture 25 - Section 13.2 Coloring Graphs Lecture 26 - Section 14.1 \u0026amp; 14.2 The Max Flow-Min Cut Theorem ","date":1595919754,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1595919754,"objectID":"ba7335eafcd68f9682ddbd008f2f36b1","permalink":"https://linbo.one/zh/courses/2019fall-math2603/","publishdate":"2020-07-28T03:02:34-04:00","relpermalink":"/zh/courses/2019fall-math2603/","section":"courses","summary":"Syllabus Course Syllabus Lecture Slides Lecture 1 - Chapter 0 Lecture 2 - Chapter 1 Lecture 3 - Section 1.3, Section 2.1 \u0026amp; 2.2 Lecture 4 - Section 2.3 \u0026amp; 2.","tags":[],"title":"Math 2603 - Fall 2019","type":"courses"},{"authors":["Bo Lin"],"categories":[],"content":"爱好 桌游。这是我在BoardGameArena网站的 帐号。 观看各种体育比赛，包括足球、篮球、曲棍球、冰壶等。 打 地板球。 编辑 维基百科。 学习各种语言，包括德语、世界语、韩语等。 技能 围棋 业余3段。 初级 世界语 使用者：Mi ĝojas uzi Esperanton!

Previous studies showed this property reflected the expressivity of a neural network family (Montufar et al.); as a result, it can be used to characterize how the structural complexity of a neural network model affects the function it aims to compute. Nonetheless, it is challenging to directly compute the number of linear regions; therefore, many researchers focus on estimating the bounds (in particular the upper bound) of the number of linear regions for deep neural networks using ReLU. These methods, however, attempted to estimate the upper bound in the entire input space. The theoretical methods are still lacking to estimate the number of linear regions within a specific area of the input space, e.g., a sphere centered at a training data point such as an adversarial example or a backdoor trigger. In this paper, we present the first method to estimate the upper bound of the number of linear regions in any sphere in the input space of a given ReLU neural network. We implemented the method, and computed the bounds in deep neural networks using the piece-wise linear active function. Our experiments showed that, while training a neural network, the boundaries of the linear regions tend to move away from the training data points. In addition, we observe that the spheres centered at the training data points tend to contain more linear regions than any arbitrary points in the input space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of bounding linear regions around a specific data point. We consider our work as a first step toward the investigation of the structural complexity of deep neural networks in a specific input area.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Bounding The Number of Linear Regions in Local Area for Neural Networks with ReLU Activations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bo Lin"],"categories":[],"content":"Syllabus Course Syllabus\nLecture Slides Lecture 1 - Chapter 1 Lecture 2 - Section 2.1 Lecture 3 - Section 2.2 Lecture 4 - Section 2.3 Lecture 5 - Section 3.1\u0026amp;3.2 Lecture 6 - Section 3.3\u0026amp;3.4 Lecture 7 - Section 4.1 Lecture 8 - Section 4.2\u0026amp;4.3 Lecture 9 - Section 4.4\u0026amp;4.5 Lecture 10 - Section 4.6\u0026amp;Review Lecture 11 - Section 5.1 Lecture 12 - Section 5.2 Lecture 13 - Section 5.3 Lecture 14 - Section 5.4\u0026amp;5.5 Lecture 15 - Section 6.1 Lecture 16 - Section 6.2 Lecture 17 - Section 7.1 Lecture 18 - Section 7.2 Lecture 19 - Section 7.3 Lecture 20 - Section 7.4 Lecture 21 - Section 8.1\u0026amp;8.2 Lecture 22 - Section 8.3 Lecture 23 - Section 8.4 Lecture 24 - Section 9.1\u0026amp;9.2 Lecture 25 - Section 9.3\u0026amp;9.4 Lecture 26 - Section 9.5\u0026amp;9.6 Exams with solutions Midterm Exam 1 Midterm Exam 1 - Solution Midterm Exam 2 Midterm Exam 2 - Solution Final Exam Practice Final Exam Practice - Solution Final Exam Final Exam - Solution ","date":1573862400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1595894400,"objectID":"aee3e6d69bf502427d36781ea502187a","permalink":"https://linbo.one/zh/courses/2018fall-m325k/","publishdate":"2019-11-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/courses/2018fall-m325k/","section":"courses","summary":"Syllabus Course Syllabus\nLecture Slides Lecture 1 - Chapter 1 Lecture 2 - Section 2.1 Lecture 3 - Section 2.2 Lecture 4 - Section 2.3 Lecture 5 - Section 3.1\u0026amp;3.2 Lecture 6 - Section 3.","tags":[],"title":"M325K - Fall 2018","type":"courses"},{"authors":["Bo Lin"],"categories":[],"content":"Syllabus Course Syllabus\nLecture Slides Exams with solutions ","date":1573862400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1595919830,"objectID":"889d0f8b1d6b00522f8dcffde2af0cab","permalink":"https://linbo.one/zh/courses/2018summer-m328k/","publishdate":"2019-11-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/courses/2018summer-m328k/","section":"courses","summary":"Syllabus Course Syllabus\nLecture Slides Exams with solutions ","tags":[],"title":"M328K - Summer 2018","type":"courses"},{"authors":["Wonjun Lee","Wuchen Li","Bo Lin","Anthea Monod"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1573603200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1573603200,"objectID":"748cdc00633ce805df8e9052934d6fbc","permalink":"https://linbo.one/zh/publication/tropical-optimal-transport-and-wasserstein-distances/","publishdate":"2021-06-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/tropical-optimal-transport-and-wasserstein-distances/","section":"publication","summary":"We study the problem of optimal transport in tropical geometry and define the Wasserstein-p distances in the continuous metric measure space setting of the tropical projective torus.
