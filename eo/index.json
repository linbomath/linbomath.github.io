Previous studies showed this property reflected the expressivity of a neural network family (Montufar et al.); as a result, it can be used to characterize how the structural complexity of a neural network model affects the function it aims to compute. Nonetheless, it is challenging to directly compute the number of linear regions; therefore, many researchers focus on estimating the bounds (in particular the upper bound) of the number of linear regions for deep neural networks using ReLU. These methods, however, attempted to estimate the upper bound in the entire input space. The theoretical methods are still lacking to estimate the number of linear regions within a specific area of the input space, e.g., a sphere centered at a training data point such as an adversarial example or a backdoor trigger. In this paper, we present the first method to estimate the upper bound of the number of linear regions in any sphere in the input space of a given ReLU neural network. We implemented the method, and computed the bounds in deep neural networks using the piece-wise linear active function. Our experiments showed that, while training a neural network, the boundaries of the linear regions tend to move away from the training data points. In addition, we observe that the spheres centered at the training data points tend to contain more linear regions than any arbitrary points in the input space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of bounding linear regions around a specific data point. We consider our work as a first step toward the investigation of the structural complexity of deep neural networks in a specific input area.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Bounding The Number of Linear Regions in Local Area for Neural Networks with ReLU Activations","type":"eo"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":[],"content":"Syllabus Course Syllabus\nLecture Slides  Lecture 1 -

We show that the set of all tropical Fermat--Weber points of a finite sample is always a classical convex polytope, and we present a combinatorial formula for a key value associated with this set. We identify conditions under which this set is a singleton. We apply numerical experiments to analyze the set of the tropical Fermat--Weber points within a space of phylogenetic trees.

As data objects, they are characterized by the challenges associated with \"big data,\" as well as the complication that their discrete geometric structure results in a non-Euclidean phylogenetic tree space, which poses computational and statistical limitations. We propose and study a novel framework based on tropical geometry and discuss its implications in the statistical analysis of evolutionary biological processes represented by phylogenetic trees. Our setting exhibits analytic, geometric, and topological properties that are desirable for theoretical studies in probability and statistics, as well as increased computational efficiency over the current state-of-the-art.
