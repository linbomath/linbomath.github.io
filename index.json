Previous studies showed this property reflected the expressivity of a neural network family (Montufar et al.); as a result, it can be used to characterize how the structural complexity of a neural network model affects the function it aims to compute. Nonetheless, it is challenging to directly compute the number of linear regions; therefore, many researchers focus on estimating the bounds (in particular the upper bound) of the number of linear regions for deep neural networks using ReLU. These methods, however, attempted to estimate the upper bound in the entire input space. The theoretical methods are still lacking to estimate the number of linear regions within a specific area of the input space, e.g., a sphere centered at a training data point such as an adversarial example or a backdoor trigger. In this paper, we present the first method to estimate the upper bound of the number of linear regions in any sphere in the input space of a given ReLU neural network. We implemented the method, and computed the bounds in deep neural networks using the piece-wise linear active function. Our experiments showed that, while training a neural network, the boundaries of the linear regions tend to move away from the training data points. In addition, we observe that the spheres centered at the training data points tend to contain more linear regions than any arbitrary points in the input space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of bounding linear regions around a specific data point. We consider our work as a first step toward the investigation of the structural complexity of deep neural networks in a specific input area.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Bounding The Number of Linear Regions in Local Area for Neural Networks with ReLU Activations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bo Lin"],"categories":[],"content":"Syllabus Course Syllabus\nLecture Slides  Lecture 1 - Chapter 1 Lecture 2 - Section 2.1 Lecture 3 - Section 2.2 Lecture 4 - Section 2.3 Lecture 5 - Section 3.1\u0026amp;3.2 Lecture 6 - Section 3.3\u0026amp;3.4 Lecture 7 - Section 4.1 Lecture 8 - Section 4.2\u0026amp;4.3 Lecture 9 - Section 4.4\u0026amp;4.5 Lecture 10 - Section 4.6\u0026amp;Review Lecture 11 - Section 5.1 Lecture 12 - Section 5.2 Lecture 13 - Section 5.3 Lecture 14 - Section 5.4\u0026amp;5.5 Lecture 15 - Section 6.1 Lecture 16 - Section 6.2 Lecture 17 - Section 7.1 Lecture 18 - Section 7.2 Lecture 19 - Section 7.3 Lecture 20 - Section 7.4 Lecture 21 - Section 8.1\u0026amp;8.2 Lecture 22 - Section 8.3 Lecture 23 - Section 8.4 Lecture 24 - Section 9.1\u0026amp;9.2 Lecture 25 - Section 9.3\u0026amp;9.4 Lecture 26 - Section 9.5\u0026amp;9.6  Exams with solutions  Midterm Exam 1 Midterm Exam 1 - Solution Midterm Exam 2 Midterm Exam 2 - Solution Final Exam Practice Final Exam Practice - Solution Final Exam Final Exam - Solution  ","date":1573862400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595894400,"objectID":"aee3e6d69bf502427d36781ea502187a","permalink":"https://linbo.one/courses/2018fall-m325k/","publishdate":"2019-11-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/2018fall-m325k/","section":"courses","summary":"Syllabus Course Syllabus\nLecture Slides  Lecture 1 - Chapter 1 Lecture 2 - Section 2.1 Lecture 3 - Section 2.2 Lecture 4 - Section 2.3 Lecture 5 - Section 3.","tags":[],"title":"M325K - Fall 2018","type":"courses"},{"authors":["Bo Lin"],"categories":[],"content":"Syllabus Course Syllabus\nLecture Slides Exams with solutions ","date":1573862400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595919830,"objectID":"889d0f8b1d6b00522f8dcffde2af0cab","permalink":"https://linbo.one/courses/2018summer-m328k/","publishdate":"2019-11-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/2018summer-m328k/","section":"courses","summary":"Syllabus Course Syllabus\nLecture Slides Exams with solutions ","tags":[],"title":"M328K - Summer 2018","type":"courses"},{"authors":["Wonjun Lee","Wuchen Li","Bo Lin","Anthea Monod"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1573603200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573603200,"objectID":"9e0e338791696f32791402ef1137699d","permalink":"https://linbo.one/publication/tropical-optimal-transport-and-wasserstein-distances-in-phylogenetic-tree-space/","publishdate":"2020-07-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tropical-optimal-transport-and-wasserstein-distances-in-phylogenetic-tree-space/","section":"publication","summary":"We study the problem of optimal transport on phylogenetic tree space from the perspective of tropical geometry, and thus define the Wasserstein-p distances for probability measures in this continuous metric measure space setting.

We propose and study a novel framework based on tropical geometry and discuss its implications in the statistical analysis of evolutionary biological processes represented by phylogenetic trees. Our setting exhibits analytic, geometric, and topological properties that are desirable for theoretical studies in probability and statistics, as well as increased computational efficiency over the current state-of-the-art. We demonstrate our approach on seasonal influenza data.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Tropical Geometry of Phylogenetic Tree Space: A Statistical Perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bo Lin","Martin Ulirsch"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1510876800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1510876800,"objectID":"2e0eb0fff07f98b0d8ba8a3088b8247d","permalink":"https://linbo.one/publication/towards-a-tropical-hodge-bundle/","publishdate":"2020-07-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/towards-a-tropical-hodge-bundle/","section":"publication","summary":"The moduli space $M_g^{trop}$ of tropical curves of genus $g$ is a generalized cone complex that parametrizes metric vertex-weighted graphs of genus $g$.

The $CAT-0$ metric of Billera-Holmes-Vogtman arises from the theory of orthant spaces. While its geodesics can be computed by the Owen-Provan algorithm, geodesic triangles are complicated. We show that the dimension of such a triangle can be arbitrarily high. Tropical convexity and the tropical metric exhibit properties that are desirable for geometric statistics, such as geodesics of small depth.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Convexity in Tree Spaces","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bo Lin","Ngoc Mai Tran"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1499731200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1499731200,"objectID":"16fa5ccb49a99e002e885a60e287272a","permalink":"https://linbo.one/publication/linear-and-rational-factorization-of-tropical-polynomials/","publishdate":"2020-07-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/linear-and-rational-factorization-of-tropical-polynomials/","section":"publication","summary":"Already for bivariate tropical polynomials, factorization is an NP-Complete problem.
